##  credit card customer churn project


about dataset:

Amanger at the bank is distrbuted with more and more customers leaving thier credit card services. they would realy appreciate if one could predict for them
who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to yhe customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction
I got this dataset from kaggle. I have been using this for awhile to get datasets and accordingly work on them to produce frutiful results.
Now this dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning thier age, salary, marital staus, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. there are nearly 18 features.
I used number of classification models like Logistic regression, xgbclassifier to classify customers who need to be alerted, and the excpected result was 100%.
